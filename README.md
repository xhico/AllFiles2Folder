## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to organize a cluttered folder by moving all files to one location? File Organizer is here to help!

It also deletes the now-empty subfolders, leaving you with a neatly organized main folder.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simply provide the path to the main folder, and the script takes care of the rest.
- **Organize Files**: Move all files from subfolders to the main folder.
- **Cleanup**: Delete empty subfolders after organizing files.
